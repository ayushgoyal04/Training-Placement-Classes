# Training-Placement-Classes
This repository is a central hub for accessing all the codes from the contests held during our placement training classes. 

Whether you're revisiting a problem, studying for an upcoming interview, or simply interested in exploring solutions, you'll find everything you need right here.

### What's Inside:

**Contest Codes**: Each contest will have its dedicated folder containing the solutions. These solutions are exemplary works crafted by our talented classmates during the heat of the competition.


### How to Use:

1. **Navigation**: Use the folder structure to navigate to the specific contest you're interested in exploring. Each contest folder is intuitively labeled for easy identification.

2. **Code Review**: Dive into the solutions provided by your peers. Analyze different approaches, coding styles, and optimization techniques employed to tackle the problems.

3. **Learning Resources**: These codes are not just solutions but valuable learning resources. Take advantage of them to enhance your problem-solving skills and prepare for future challenges, be it in interviews or real-world projects.

### Contributing:

**Sharing Your Solutions**: Did you come up with an innovative solution during the contest? Feel free to contribute by adding your code to the respective contest folder. Your contributions enrich the repository and benefit fellow classmates.

**Improvements and Suggestions**: Have ideas for improving existing solutions or the repository structure? We welcome your suggestions and contributions to make this repository even more valuable for everyone.


### Disclaimer:

Please note that these solutions are provided by participants and may vary in approach and efficiency. While they offer valuable insights, there may be alternative solutions or optimizations worth exploring.

New solutions will only be added after the contest is over.

Happy coding and best of luck with your placement training journey! Thank You
